# What is multithreading

Multithreading is the ability in a CPU to provide multiple threads of executions,
in other words how many tasks a CPU can handle at a time.
In theory, if you use multiple threads of a CPU you will distribute the load of an operation across multiple threads,
which will solve their assigned tasks. This will lead to an overall performance improvement,
as the CPU will be able to handle work on several tasks at the same time.
